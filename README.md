# Feedback Loop

## Description

>Duration, Weekend Effort

This weekend project was centered around creating a feedback form that tracks submissions over multiple pages. The purpose of this project was centered around my ability to handle information with react/redux so I made sure to use those those technologies accordingly. On the final page, feedback information is posted and stored to the db but no further calls to the db are made.

With more time I would like to create an admin page where you would be able to view all submissions and I would also like to update the current form (rather than add to it) when a user decides to use the back button to change one of their answers.
