# Feedback Loop

## Description

>Duration, Weekend Effort

This weekend project was centered around creating a feedback form that tracks submissions over multiple pages. The purpose of this project was centered around my ability to handle information with react/redux so I made sure to use those those technologies accordingly. On the final page, feedback information is posted and stored to the db but no further calls to the db are made.

With more time I would like to create an admin page where you would be able to view all submissions and I would also like to update the current form (rather than add to it) when a user decides to use the back button to change one of their answers.

3. npm run client, npm run server

## Usage

1. Using a full window for viewing, progress through the feedback form using the buttons located in the bottom right of the screen.
2. Select values that best answer each question as prompted.
3. Review your selections.
4. Confirm by clicking Submit or return to previous pages via the back buttons page.
5. Use the 'Thank You' page to begin a new entry if desired.
